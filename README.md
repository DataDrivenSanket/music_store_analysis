# Music Store Database Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the sales data of a music store using MySQL. The database is structured into multiple tables, each representing different entities such as albums, artists, customers, and sales. The SQL scripts provided can be used to recreate the database and perform various analyses to extract business insights.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following SQL files:
- **music_store_album.sql**: Contains the schema and data for the `album` table.
- **music_store_artist.sql**: Contains the schema and data for the `artist` table.
- **music_store_customer.sql**: Contains the schema and data for the `customer` table.
- **music_store_employee.sql**: Contains the schema and data for the `employee` table.
- **music_store_genre.sql**: Contains the schema and data for the `genre` table.
- **music_store_invoice.sql**: Contains the schema and data for the `invoice` table.
- **music_store_invoice_line.sql**: Contains the schema and data for the `invoice_line` table.
- **music_store_media_type.sql**: Contains the schema and data for the `media_type` table.
- **music_store_playlist.sql**: Contains the schema and data for the `playlist` table.
- **music_store_playlist_track.sql**: Contains the schema and data for the `playlist_track` table.
- **music_store_track.sql**: Contains the schema and data for the `track` table.
  

## How to Use This Project

### Prerequisites
- **MySQL**: Make sure you have MySQL installed on your machine.
- **MySQL Workbench** or any other SQL client to run the scripts.

### Steps to Recreate the Database
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-store-analysis.git
2. Open MySQL Workbench (or your preferred SQL client).
3. **Create a New Database**: Create a new database where you will import the SQL files
   CREATE DATABASE music_store;
   USE music_store;
4. Import SQL Files:
Import each .sql file in the correct order (if necessary), or run all the scripts one by one.


## Project Highlights

**Database Design**: The database is designed to efficiently store and manage music store data, including customers, invoices, tracks, artists, and genres.

**SQL Proficiency**: The project demonstrates the use of advanced SQL queries, including joins, subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

**Business Insights**: The analyses performed provide valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and market opportunities.
